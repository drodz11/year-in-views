# About this site
I watch a lot of movies in a variety of ways. This site is an effort to use my viewing data to try and learn something about my habits. It uses the Jekyll [Minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/drodz11/year-in-views).

I've made a couple of other sites for projects about [Ozu's color films](https://drodz11.github.io/colors-of-ozu/) and [3D visualizations of experimental film & video](https://drodz11.github.io/particlesinspace/).

I also make [films and videos](https://claviluxarchival.com/film-video/), [music](https://blacksink.bandcamp.com/), and [work in the LAM sector](https://hidave.info/).
